# Timberborn Harmony mod
A simple wrapper for a C# patching library called Harmony, to make it ready to use in Timberborn mods. Learn about Harmony [here](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) and [here](https://harmony.pardeike.net/)

## How to use
If you are making your mod using Unity, install this repository as a github package via the Package Manager.

If you are modding using an IDE, reference the Harmony dll from the Harmony mod, which you can find on mod.io or on the Steam Workshop.

To test it in-game, install the Harmony mod from mod.io or Steam Workshop.

When releasing your mod, don't forget to setup Harmony mod as a required mod, both in manifest.json and on the site you are uploading it to.
